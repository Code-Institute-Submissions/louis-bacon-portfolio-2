## Responsiveness

The website was tested in Google Chrome using the [Viewport Resizer](https://bit.ly/2H7B9cY) extension, [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and the [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/checker.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Flbacon17.github.io%2Flouis-bacon-portfolio-2%2F&width=1400&height=700).

The website's layout was tested pixel by pixel and on all popular mobile and tablet devices. The design is consistently responsive at all screen sizes and there is no change in the appearance or performance of interactive features. The only minor issues noted were as follows: 

* the alert boxes generated by potential user actions can appear slightly larger and misaligned on some extra small screens (iPhone 6/7/8 and smaller) due to their text content taking up more lines

* the Google reCAPTCHA box below the contact forms is slightly misaligned with the submit button on 19" desktops and above.

## Browser Compatibility

The website was tested in the following Browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Brave Browser
* Mozilla Firefox
* Safari
* Opera

The website proved good compatibility with all browsers as the functionality and performance was consistent across the board. I observed the following minor issues: 

* the add to cart buttons are surrounded by a thin grey shadow in Mozilla Firefox as if the rest of the page were slightly set back. Nonetheless their position on the page and the clarity of the add to cart icon makes the button functionality clear.

* the date of birth input field in contact forms accepts non-numeric characters in Safari as the browser does not recognise the input type="date" attribute. To address the issue I took the following steps:

1. Added a placeholder attribute with a value of "dd/mm/yyyy" which clearly indicates to the user that they must input a date of birth. This also replicates the appearance in other browsers.

2. Setting a minlength and attribute with a value of 10 characters (including '/'). These attributes will not affect the output in browsers that support the date input type attribute.

3. Added JavaScript to loop through DOB input fields (all of which have an id of "dob") and prevent input of non-numeric keys or forward slashes using the ASCII codes for these characters.

## Testing of User Stories

1. As a business, I want to market myself as effectively as possible to internet users and generate more clients and product sales. I therefore advertise my products, services and their pricing as transparently as possible, and present the opportunity to purchase or sign up to a service via my website.

* When the user navigates the website, they will see my brand logo on top of my name and my services in large text at the top of every page in the navigation bar. The services are also all clickable links that will take the user to the relevant page where they can make use of a service.

* If the user wants to buy one of my t-shirts or books, they can add the item to their cart with a single click, and the quantity of items inside the cart will update for the user in real time. The price is calculated automatically on the cart page so that the user knows how much they are paying.

* The user can see clear, high-quality thumbnail images of all of my t-shirts and books with clear pricing information. They are also informed of my rates for tutoring and fitness coaching in advance of submitting the form.

* The user will encounter several invitations to join my mailing list throughout the website, meaning I have the opportunity to sell to them in the future if they submit their e-mail address, even if they choose not to buy from me immediately.

2. As someone needing a website designed, I want to quickly be able to see what Louis can offer and access his GitHub profile to check out examples of his work.

* The user can click the 'Web Developer' heading under my name or select 'Web Services' from the 'Shop' dropdown menu. They can then read information about my experience and click on the link to my GitHub profile.

* They can also select 'All Items' from the dropdown menu and scroll to the bottom where they will find the same content in the Web Services section.

3. As a student or a parent of a student needing tuition, I want to book lessons by filling out a simple form and receive confirmation once I have done so. This is more reliable than trying to reach him at a contact number or e-mail address when he may be busy and take a while to reply.

* The user can click the 'Tutor' heading under my name or select 'Tutoring' from the 'Shop' dropdown menu. They can then provide their details in the contact form, verify themselves as a human being and submit the form. I will receive a notification that somebody has filled out the contact form and see the form's input data, while the user will receive a confirmation e-mail that their form has been submitted.

* Alternatively, they can scroll down to the 'Tutoring' section on the main shop page, or navigate to the 'Contact' page and make an enquiry by filling out the form, where they will again receive a confirmation e-mail. All submitted forms reach me at the same e-mail address so I am able to respond to any enquiry as soon as possible.

4. As a person looking to buy clothes I want to see what products Louis designs and sells, how much they cost and make a purchase in just a few clicks. I also want the opportunity to buy more than one of a certain item or remove an item from my basket after changing my mind.

* The user can click the 'Clothing Brand' heading under my name or select 'Merchandise' or 'All Items' from the 'Shop' dropdown menu. Here they will see all of my clothing products, what they look like and how much they cost. They then click the add to cart button and get an instant notification that the product was successfully added to the cart, and the checkout counter instantly increases. This gives the user a clear response to their action. Due to the fixed nature of the navigation bar, the user will always be able to see how many items are in their cart.

* Once on the cart page, the user can click the + and - icons next to the item name to increase and decrease the quantity to their desired amount. If they change their mind on ordering an item, they can click on the 'x' on the left of the image thumbnail to remove it from the cart. Should they wish to go back and add another item to their basket, they can click the 'Continue Shopping' button at the bottom of the cart. Items will remain stored in the user's cart even if they navigate to another page or leave the website entirely.

* Once the user is happy with their order, they click the 'Checkout' button at the bottom of the cart. Its appearance makes it clearly stand out as the call to action button on the page.

5. As a fitness enthusiast looking for some advice or to learn more, I want to see what sort of content Louis has written and purchase some of his work from his website.

* The user can click the 'Fitness Coach' heading under my name or select 'Fitness' from the 'Shop' dropdown menu. Here they can see the books I've written on the subject so far. The image thumbnail of each book shows a clear picture of the cover to give the user a preview and the title is informative enough so that the user knows what type of content is within. Again there is clear pricing information for each book.

* If the user wishes to make a purchase, they can click on the add to cart button, where they receive an instant alert that the item was added to their cart and the number in the cart increases by one. They can then navigate to the cart page by clicking on the shopping cart icon in the navigation bar and complete their purchase.

6. I can also book a coaching session if I wish. I am informed that rates are negotiable and can book sessions by submitting a form in which I can provide information about my goals and situation in more detail so that Louis has what he needs to start working with me.

* The user can click the 'Fitness Coach' heading under my name or select 'Fitness' from the 'Shop' dropdown menu. They can scroll down to the fitness coach section where they can see information about my coaching and rates. They can fill out the form to enquire or book an initial consultation with me where they must give a brief description of their goals. They are encouraged to give just a brief description as asking for too much detail increases the risk of the user being distracted and not completing the form. We can go into more detail once I've responded to the user's enquiry and set up an appointment.

* Once the user has verified themselves as a real person and submitted the form with their details, they will receive a confirmation e-mail that I have received their request and will be in touch as soon as possible. The text above the form sets their expectations by noting that I'll respond within 24 hours, so the user has a rough timeframe of how long they'll have to wait before hearing from me.

7. I have a brilliant project idea that I think Louis would be great for, but I want to get his view on it first. I'd like to find the best way to contact Louis and send him an enquiry about it.

* The user can click on 'Contact' in the navigation bar and be taken to the contact page. They can easily locate the contact form and fill it out with their details and some information about the project and await my response. They can again expect a response within 24 hours, as the form states, and will receive a confirmation e-mail once their form has been successfully submitted.

8. As a potential client of Louis', I'm considering working with him on something but can read about his prior experience on his CV page and compare it to other prospective contractors. I'd also like the option of downloading his CV in case I want to look into his experience in a bit more detail and take some time to decide.

* The user can click 'CV' in the navigation bar and be taken to the CV page. They can scroll down to find a timeline of my professional history.

* Should the user need more detail, they can easily locate the button to download a PDF of my CV immediately below the timeline. This opens in a new tab so the user can continue browsing my website at the same time if need me. The user can also print my full CV or save it to their device so that they can look at it in future without even being on my website. This gives them all the time and resources they need to decide whether to work with me.

* If the user wishes to proceed with a project, they can navigate to the 'Contact' page from the main menu and fill out the contact form.

9. As someone who wants to find out a bit more about Louis himself, I can read his story in more detail on the About page.

* The user can click on 'About' in the navigation bar to be taken to my About page. They can then read a more detailed biography of my story and find some images of me and my work to put a face to the name. 

* If the user is still curious, there is an invitation to join my mailing list immediately below the images so that the user can hear more from me. All they need to do is input their e-mail address and verify themselves as a human being. The form will not submit with an invalid e-mail address or without the reCAPTCHA box being checked. If they try to submit the form without verifying themselves, they will receive a dismissible alert indicating that they must pass verification.

10. As someone who's interested in learning more from Louis and wants to hear from him regularly, I can join his mailing list by simply submitting my e-mail address.

* The user can click the last paragraph of my introduction on the homepage to be taken directly to the mailing list section. They then just need to enter their e-mail address, click subscribe and check the Google reCAPTCHA validation box to join my mailing list. They will then receive a confirmation e-mail that they are now subscribed, and they can look forward to plenty of exciting content. I will also receive an automated e-mail notifying me of a new mailing list subscriber, so that I know to include the user in future e-mails.

## Issues/Bugs

The following issues were encountered during the testing phase:

* Trying to remove an item from the cart returned an error of "cannot read property type of undefined" when trying to access an item's name. I discovered that in accessing the text content of the button's parent div, the browser was also inadvertendly accessing the text content of the screen reader span, meaning the item name was returned twice and therefore not recognised as a product in the cart. I resolved the bug by amending the method to traversing through the sibling elements:

``` 
itemName = removeItem[i].nextElementSibling.nextElementSibling.nextElementSibling.textContent.trim().toLocaleLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "");
```

* The fitness books would appear as the wrong items in the cart if added via the fitness page. This was because they were the only items on this page, meaning the for loop was reading them as the first two items in the products array. The solution to this was twofold:

1. I split the books into a separate array called 'books' which stored their properties.
2. I added further classes to the add to cart buttons, .add-merch for the t-shirts and .add-book for the array, and accessed the buttons via these classes instead of the shared .add-item class when adding to cart. The functions displaying the cart data would then be called with the respective arguments parsed in.

```
var carts = document.querySelectorAll(".add-merch");
var basket = document.querySelectorAll(".add-book");

for (let i = 0; i < carts.length; i++) {
    carts[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
        cartQty(products[i]);
        cartTotal(products[i]);
        displayAlert();
    })
}

for (let i = 0; i < basket.length; i++) {
    basket[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
        cartQty(books[i]);
        cartTotal(books[i]);
        displayAlert();
    })
}
```

* The first item on any page could not be added to the cart more than once - the alert would appear when the button was clicked but the counter would not increase by more than one. This was solved by accessing the data via the button's .add-item class rather than its parent .add-to-cart div.

* If all items were removed from the cart it was still possible for the user to receive an alert thanking them for their purchase if they clicked the checkout button. This was solved by incorporating an if/else statement into the completePurchase() function that would return an error if there were no items in the cart:

```
function completePurchase() {
    var productQty = localStorage.getItem("cartQty");
    var cartContainer = document.querySelector("#products");
    if (productQty > 0) {
        alert ("Thank you for your purchase!");
        document.querySelector("#counter").textContent = 0;
        localStorage.clear();

        cartContainer.innerHTML = "";
        cartContainer.innerHTML = `
            <div class="cart-item-wrapper">
                <h2 class="empty-cart">Your cart is currently empty.</h2>
                <h6 class="back-to-shop-heading">
                    <a href="shop.html" class="back-to-shop-link">Back to shop.</a>
                </h6>
            </div>
        `;
    } else {
        alert ("There are no items in your cart. Please add at least one item to your cart in order to complete your purchase!");
        return false;
    }
}
```

* On the deployed version of the website, the console returns an uncaught typeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null at loadCart (cart.js:248) at (cart.js:366). This refers to the else part of the if/else statement that sets the inner HTML of the cart - if the local storage is empty, the message appears that the cart is empty. I have decided to leave this bug unfixed for the time being as it does not affect the site performance or user experience, while any attempted workarounds caused glitches in the cart page updating, which would have worsened the UX. In future versions of the site, I will seek a solution that resets the cart page's HTML to the same text if the last item is removed from the cart.

* On the cart page, if there was not enough content the footer was being pushed up from the bottom of page leaving white space at the bottom. This was resolved by taking the following steps:

1. Set the footer's position to absolute and give it a height property with the appropriate value
2. Wrap the entire body in a div and set its position to relative and height to 100vh
3. To avoid overflow from the main body of content into the footer, set the padding-bottom of the div enclosing the main body of content to the equivalent of the footer's height.
4. The footer's height will be different at different screen sizes, so add media queries to ensure it remains at the bottom of the page no matter the screen width 

* On the cart page, if scrolled down from the top, when I clicked on the increase/decrease quantity or remove item icons, the browser would return to the top of the page. Although the action achieved the desired repsonse, it was still frustrating user experience as the user would have to spend time scrolling back down if they wanted to add or remove more items from the cart. I resolved this by removing the href attribute from the anchor tags that enclosed these icons. I then added the cursor: pointer property to the remove-item, decrease-qty and increase-qty classes in the CSS file to ensure the user would have the same response when hovering over the icons.

* The Google reCAPTCHA box would overflow off the edge of the screen on smaller screen sizes and misalign with the call to action button or input fields above it. To solve the issue I targeted the innermost div generated by the Google API whose width is set to 304 pixels. I overrode this attribute by setting the width to 100% and adding the !important property so that the div containing the reCAPTCHA box would always be the same width as its parent div. I also created a number of media queries targeting the rc-container div using the -webkit-transform property to shrink the reCAPTCHA box at smaller screen sizes.

* The Google reCAPTCHA box misaligned with the mailing list form at certain screen sizes. I added the class mailing-list-offset to the RC box's parent div on the relevant pages and gave it a margin-left property.

* There was a similar problem with the reCAPTCHA box below contact forms at larger screen sizes. The box would align centrally to the form itself rather than the submit button immediately above, creating an unnatural staggered appearance. I therefore used the rc-aligner class for the parent div below the various contact forms (not mailing list sign-ups) on the website and added a margin-left property with a different value to that of the mailing-list-offset class.

* The Google reCAPTCHA alert that appears when the user attempts to submit a form without verifying themselves overflowed into the footer at certain screen sizes. This was resolved by giving it a padding-bottom property.
